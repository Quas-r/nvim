# Quas-r's Neovim Configuration

This is the ~/.config/nvim/ directory that I use to configure Neovim to my liking.

I have made this repository to be able to use the same configuration on multiple systems just by cloning this repository.

To use it, simply do:
```
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/Quas-r/nvim.git
```
